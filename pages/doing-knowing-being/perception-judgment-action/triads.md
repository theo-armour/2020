## John Locke

All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either,
Perceptions: first, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or,
Judgments: secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or,

Actions: thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated; I
