### Full Screen: [US County Votes]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/sandbox/us-county-votes/ )


## Concept

Mission

To display the changes in voting margins by party over a series of elections for every county in the USA

Vision

Where do we want this to go? and why?

## To Do / Wish List

* Stop globe redraws on year change
* More comprehensive cursor display
* Add indicators that show which counties have flipped since previous vote
* Show geoJSON in 3D


## Issues


* 2020-11-06 ~ The borders of some counties along the oceans are missing
* 2020-11-06 ~ The software is un-optimized amd may run quite slowly on a non-gaming computer

### Election data

* https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib//elections/statistics.html
* https://libguides.princeton.edu/elections
* https://electionlab.mit.edu/data


## Change Log

### 2020-12-07

* Add sphere with texture reprsenting the Earth
* Change data to "County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2016" from MIT Election Data and Science Lab ~ https://electionlab.mit.edu/data
* Refactor code to display MIT data
	* Allow for "Democratic", "Republican" and "Other" categories
* Update display at cursor

Dealt with

* Add bitmap map underlay
* Better and more authoritative statistics

### 2020-12-02

The goal is to create a map that people can look at and - without reading instructions or looking at a legend - in a few seconds mostly "get the picture" know what is going on. It's taking time, but each release gets things a bit better,

The red and blue sticks kind of give the idea that this map is about US politics

The width of the sticks gives the idea that it's an indication of population

The height of the ticks representing party votes is less easy to get - stil a work-in-progress

Today:

* Rejigged the shape of the sticks (process was trickier than I thought )
* Rejigged pop-up text and menu text
* Slowed rotate speed

### 2020-12-01

Should load faster and use fewer resources ~ vbut lose variety of colors
Part way through adding a fuller user interface - should now work better on mobile phones
Starting to add usage text - see info button
3D experience needs a lot of work

Click setStats button to see how many frames per second
- Windows 10 with Nvidia graphics card - 60fps
- Chromebook ~ 23 fps
- Google Pixel 4 ~ 44 fps

### 2020-11-26

* Losers are dimmed
* Add links to links of interest
* Dems horizontal. Reps vertical
* Vertical scale set to logarithmic
* Colors are official party colors

Dealt with

* 2020-11-06 ~ Add buttons or sliders to select data from all the election years in the available data set
* 2020-11-06 ~ Add a range of colors to indicate the magnitude of the margins for the winning party in each county
* 2020-11-06 ~ Currently only shows party voting data for 2018 with no indication of margin magnitude
* 2020-11-06 ~ The map projection is set for a spherical projection - causing the map to not look like a more normal mercator projection

### 2020-11-25

* Shift to spherical coordinates
* Slow down rotate speed

### 2020-11-24

Differentiating the vote using color is problematic. Using geometry is preferred.
The over-arching goal always: you understand the map without having to look at the legend.

* height of bars is dem or rep vote - scaled exponentially
* top width of bar total number of votes in county - scaled exponentially
* Add lights
* Switch from basic to phong material
* Set focus to select year - enable easy use of cursor keys

### 2020-11-17

* Add color varies RGB( %rep, 0, %dem)
* Add years 2010 to 2018;


### 2020-11-06

* First commit
