### Full Screen: [US County Votes]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/sandbox/us-county-votes/ )


## Concept

Mission

To display the changes in voting margins by party over a series of elections for every county in the USA

Vision

Where do we want this to go? and why?

## To Do / Wish List

* 2020-11-06 ~ Add buttons or sliders to select data from all the election years in the available data set
* 2020-11-06 ~ Add a range of colors to indicate the magnitude of the margins for the winning party in each county

## Issues

* 2020-11-06 ~ Currently only shows party voting data for 2018 with no indication of margin magnitude
* 2020-11-06 ~ The borders of some counties along the oceans are missing
* 2020-11-06 ~ The map projection is set for a spherical projection - causing the map to not look like a more normal mercator projection
* 2020-11-06 ~ The software is un-optimized amd may run quite slowly on a non-gaming computer

## Change Log

### 2020-11-25

* Shift to spherical coordinates
* Slow down rotate speed

### 2020-11-24

Differentiating the vote using color is problematic. Using geometry is preferred.
The over-arching goal always: you understand the map without having to look at the legend.

* height of bars is dem or rep vote - scaled exponentially
* top width of bar total number of votes in county - scaled exponentially
* Add lights
* Switch from basic to phong material
* Set focus to select year - enable easy use of cursor keys

### 2020-11-17

* Add color varies RGB( %rep, 0, %dem)
* Add years 2010 to 2018;


### 2020-11-06

* First commit
