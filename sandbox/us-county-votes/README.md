### Full Screen: [US County Votes]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/sandbox/us-county-votes/ )


## Concept

Mission

To display the changes in voting margins over a series of election for every county in the USA


## To Do / Wish List

* 2020-11-06 ~ Add buttons or sliders to select data from al the election years in the data set
* 2020-11-06 ~ Add a range of colors to indicate the magnitude of the margin for the winning party

## Issues

* 2020-11-06 ~ The borders of some counties along the oceans are missing
* 2020-11-06 ~ The map projection is set for a spherical projection - causing the map to not look like a more normal mercator projection
* 2020-11-06 ~ The software is un-optimized amd may run quite slowly on a non-gaming computer
