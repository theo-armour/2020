* to focus more on the dignity of work. On asking what we can do to make life better for people, whatever their credentials.
* Beyond that, we need to give workers a voice, which means thinking seriously about reversing the decline of unions.
* Why should we tax earnings from labor at a higher rate than we tax earnings from dividends and capital gains? Why do we do that?
* we have converted the adolescent years into a stress-strewn meritocratic gauntlet of high-pressure achievement that is not only bad for our society, it's bad for our kids.
* And we've turned these colleges and universities into sorting machines that dispense the credentials and define the merit that will be rewarded.
* the importance of community and national identity and a sense of belonging.
