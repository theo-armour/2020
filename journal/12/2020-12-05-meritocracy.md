### The Rise of the Meritocracy

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy
>The Rise of the Meritocracy is a book by British sociologist and politician Michael Dunlop Young which was first published in 1958.[1] It describes a dystopian society in a future United Kingdom in which intelligence and merit have become the central tenet of society, replacing previous divisions of social class and creating a society stratified between a merited power-holding elite and a disenfranchised underclass of the less merited.

> Meritocracy is part of the vision of a good society, but not of itself sufficient. There has to be a recognition that some people will not be able to succeed in life, through illness or accident or the burden of caring for others. And there has to be a recognition that meritocracy is for the many, not the few - sometimes the way people talk about meritocracy suggests that only a very few people have any talent worth mentioning, or else that the only talent that matters is the kind that produces good exam results, a place at university or a well paid job in commerce or the professions. Smart kids from deprived backgrounds should of course have access to world class educational opportunities in the state sector and the chance to go to the best universities, but there has to be more to meritocracy than simply providing an academic escape route to the good life for the 5% of each generation with the best brains.

The Meritocracy Trap: How America's Foundational Myth Feeds Inequality, Dismantles the Middle Class, and Devours the Elite Hardcover
> A revolutionary new argument from eminent Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits attacking the false promise of meritocracy

>It is an axiom of American life that advantage should be earned through ability and effort. Even as the country divides itself at every turn, the meritocratic ideal – that social and economic rewards should follow achievement rather than breeding – reigns supreme.  Both Democrats and Republicans insistently repeat meritocratic notions. Meritocracy cuts to the heart of who we are. It sustains the American dream.
