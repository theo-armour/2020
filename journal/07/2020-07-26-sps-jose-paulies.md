Hello fellow Paulies!

**Subject: Letter to SPS Rector and Board**

I am a new member to the group.  

I want to share with this group a letter than a group of fellow alums and I drafted with a list of proposed initiatives that we are urging the school to take regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion. The letter can be accessed here:

https://www.bipocatsps.org/

I would appreciate your support by reading & signing the petition and then sharing it with others within the SPS community.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!

Jose,

Bravo. Thank you so much. I signed with this as a comment:

This is long overdue. I recall as a new 5th former that one of my fellow new classmates, a great girl from the Bronx and of I believe Puerto Rican descent, left after her first semester because she felt so alienated at the school. Diversity enriches experience - although at SPS, it was all too often feared. Many conversations while at the school and as an alum with classmates and faculty of color have confirmed that the school was all the more hard for them because of the attitudes toward minorities. Heck, I got hazed for being of Jewish descent, and I am white and came from an affluent family. I have only been able to imagine what it is like for people whose racial, class and cultural backgrounds are even more different than mine were from the majority at the school. I wholeheartedly support this initiative, have wanted the school to head in this direction for decades. I would think far more highly of the school and the integrity of its focus on service and compassion if such a program were to be implemented with seriousness and skill. I stand ready to help.

Appreciative,

Diane Moss, '85

Jose and Diane M and all:

This is a promising alumni initiative that Mr. Leos is a part of below. And, it is long overdue.

The full throated support of the School will of course only really be demonstrated if the Board and its practices and systems and the people of governance join; not to do what you and others can do well -- but, to change themselves, both individually and institutionally.   

There is a difference between 1) the SPS Board putting on the face and expression of support (or aiding in the distribution  of words) for you and the initiative -- and, 2) the Board changing itself and its commitments to practices that enable the systemic overhauls you are aiding to achieve and describing.   

Recall, the SPS Board has had blacks and people of color on it for what is by now a "long time."  

Did that make a difference?  How?  Maybe.  Maybe it was "quiet difference."  Did  it accelerate the current initiative of Mr. Leos at SPS?  Maybe indirectly, maybe not.  Did it aid in uncovering abuses or facing them? Not exactly. 

I have a kind of equity comment to share that may be hard to hear now, but is intended today without malice -- it is a plain observation:  

SPS Board members (and SPS Board alums) who are black or persons of color have attacked or denied or delayed the things I have done (or just avoided them from their position of fiduciary duty)  from the year 2001 to today.  The School and its form of Board practice for the last 20 to 50 years has not actually brought out the best in people.  Neither did the "Church and its traditions."  ... As we know only too well in the areas you are getting at and in the adult child abuse area (or child on child abuse) where abusers and the abused and the complicit were of all colors and largely devoted to silence.   

By now, and stated gently, some of the people  have come around.  Some are not now here to come around.  

This is stated simply to point out that change, character and courage are not colors.  These things are more like practiced devotions that need to be honed. Especially change.  Change is hard; which is why even very well meaning people (all or any of us for example) find it really hard -- for decades or more.  

The past is with us today at SPS.  But, the way ahead can be about change and thus the past can be meaningfully faced.  It starts with everyone -- including the SPS Board -- being visibly and vocally committed to change -- and committed, in my view, to let go of practices and ways that have not helped.  

Letting go is hard.  Whole books and practices are devoted to the subject.  

In my view, it helps to listen to kind, strong, humble people who are committed to these sorts of things.  Even when it is hard and even at SPS.  SPS has these folks, if it cares to listen in timely, unforced fashion. 

Thank you for your efforts Jose and all.  This should be good.  It can be good.

Dear fellow Paulies,

I disagree strenuously with the assertion that St. Paul’s School is racist, failing to practice what it preaches or to live up to its foundational values. I would not be surprised if some of the students are racist, but that does not make the institution racist. The East Coast society and the Episcopal Church from which the school comes have long been hotbeds of liberalism. That is why Donald Trump hates them so much. Look at how SPS has influenced the world. Look at some of the names that have passed through the place: John Lindsay, John Kerry, Robert Mueller, Garry Trudeau, Bishop John Walker.

So, what is the “culture" that we are told must be changed? What is it about black students that SPS supposedly is asking them to adapt? What does it mean to "deliver equity"? We are directed to review all academic curricula with a perspective of equity and inclusion. How one does that with Euclidean geometry is a puzzle.

Reading through the entries on the Instagram page I note that among matters of concern are many that are of minimal significance or completely irrelevant. The worst instance was perpetrated by a teacher, not a student, and that teacher should have been fired at the time, as encouraging students is a fundamental part of the job.

The school has always catered to students of above average ability. How the school is going to select applicants to fit that in the absence of tests is a mystery. But if it continues that way it can only be inclusive in a very narrow sense.

Let us change what needs to be changed, and not join the frenzy that seeks to smash everything that is within reach. It is an error to think that those three deaths compel us to rethink our whole existence. There are many other deaths. The laws regarding police use of force are defectively drafted. The fact that a substantial number of American police officers are racist is not the fault of St Paul’s School.

I go along with Rory.  To give an example,  the school accepted its first Japanese student in 1947.  This was at a time when many students had fathers who had just come home from the war many of whom had suffered atrocities of the Japanese army and who may have well influenced a lot of their sons to hate all Japanese.  I think that was very forward thinking of the school.  As to how that student fared, I cannot say, but he did stay to graduate and there were many Japanese to follow.  We had Yoshiaki Shimizu  and Toshimichi Hirai when I was there in the early fifties and they were well regarded.

The fact that we have a Japanese chapter of the SPS Alumni Association in Tokyo is a tribute to the forward thinking of the school.
 
As for the school policy towards blacks at that time I would not know.  Did any apply?  I think the school was wise to put a black on the faculty first before giving out scholarships to deserving blacks.
 
The school has tried to be on the front lines when it came to loosening up its student body to include those beyond the Waspy Eastern Establishment as the social  mores among  society in general became more liberal over the years.

## DRAFT of Theo's reply

José and Diane, Alexis, Rory & Brent

Thank you all for engaging, considered and intentional messages.

In all of this dialog I am reminded of a text we all know:

### The School Payer

_"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."_


What resonates between the School Prayer and "[Letter to SPS rector and board regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion]( https://www.bipocatsps.org/ )" is that both are written in the present tense, demand agency and action, and are expressions of hope. There are no admissions of past guilt. There are no expressions of gratitude for past joys. There is is simply a call to seek outcomes that are equitable for all

Rory, Brent and Alexis: I hear you - and yet you are not as forward looking as the prayer. You discuss a past that I share. In my case, Bishop Walker and my '65 classmate Bob Hall were the first Black people I ever had a dialog with. For sure SPS has been less bad than many. For sure SPS - over the decades - has chosen to lift fingers many times. For sure we mostly did not forget to be kind.

Nonetheless there are still vast swaths of people in this world that have been and are denied the joy, friendship and happiness for which we have all prayed. And many are denied only because of their race.

The thrust in José's text is - like the prayer - forward looking. The text asks the future School to evolve so as to be eager to bear the burdens of others. The text asks that we the members of the School's community create plans for how to be thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves.

I do agree with Rory that there is currently a "frenzy" with much media hype regarding the relations between races. But the the call to action for Saint Paul's School is timeless:  

1. Be a leader in racial equity in education - and not to cease until there are million or more schools as good as Saint Paul's
2. Establish metrics, guidelines and practices that help us to measure our failures and improvements
3. Celebrate all our differences and all our similarities


The representation of a pelican piercing its breast to feed its young with its own blood is called a [“Pelican in her Piety”]( http://www.thewestologist.com/symbols/the-symbol-of-self-sacrifice ). We all know this symbol well:

![SPS-logo-2019-fullColor]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/journal/07/SPS-logo-2019-fullColor.png )
 
Now,  I'm not sure José wants us all to pierce our breasts, but I feel he is asking us to remember, to be unselfish and to bear the burdens of others. José, it's a bloody good plan.

Theo
