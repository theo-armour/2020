# liberal arts, good writing and doing cool things

Hi John

the subject of this message is just an outline of some of the thoughts and discussions we have had - and hope to continue.


The class of 1980 WordPress site we built quickly was probably dumping too much onto you all at once. so I'm thinking about a pivot. I have several questions that I would be delighted to have some answers.

Below are several thoughts and three questions. Please feel free to respond any way you feel will progress the dialog.

I think if you want to be a writer, it's always a good thing to read some good writing every day. I have a number of sources of good writing that I look at almost every day. 

for example I received any emails from this person: David Pell at https://nextdraft.com/. I also follow several writers at  https://medium.com/.

while I admit that messaging is very important in this modern era. I don't feel that the messages on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are writing. but that is a whole other topic.

The main principle is that if you want to be a good writer then you must read well too.

## 1. What do you normally read on a daily basis? 


Another aspect about being a good writer is that you better have good writing tools. 

Phones and tablets are great for writing messages, but as I just mentioned messages and "writing" are quite different. 

I write a lot, and it's easy and it's fun. how can I do this? I have access to a good computer with a good keyboard and excellent voice recognition and dictation software.

## 2. Do you have access to a pretty good computer with a very good keyboard?


We have this thing we call "liberal arts" because the people of the past wrote down their thoughts and share them publicly.

If we are to be responsible liberal arts peeps then we must follow their good examples and write stuff and make it visible to people around the world.

WordPress has been a very good way of doing that for many peopl but I think we were jumping in at the deep end.

## 3. Is there an online tool that you could use such as email, Google Docs or any other website or forum where you think you could share your thoughts?
