# AI in AEC - artificial intelligence in architecture, engineering and construction

There is a dream that artificial intelligence could be very useful and productive in helping the built environment be updateed faster, cheaper and better.

the tools, the people, and the expertise are all acailable to make this dream happen.

why isn't it happening?

the reason - as is so frequently the case with technology - the United States of America.

major CAD vendors are based in America the biggest Market is America.

whatever works in America is what the vendors build whatever can't work in America is what the vendors avoid.

let's double click into this thought.

the first idea that comes to mind with using AI and building would be to use AI to help with designing according to the building codes. if we are talking about United Kingdom or Germany or a normal country. this would be in a eminently doable. butts of Market size has been too small for the vendors to venture into this field.

In the United States, however, there is no National Building Code. Instead there are tens of thousands local codes - and most of those codes are behind paywalls. it would be a huge process to gather up all those codes and synthesize them into a reasonable workflow.

A second idea would be to use AI to help with designing certain building types. Hyundai Isis to could be very helpful in designing good schoolan AI system could be very helpful in designing better schools. Again the issue is United States. There are 10,000 or school boards and each has its own megalomania. beyond that the federal government and the states of government and local governments all have different ideas about supporting private or public schools.

a certain idea would be to drop down to a building products and component level.
