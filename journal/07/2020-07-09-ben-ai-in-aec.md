# AI in AEC - artificial intelligence in architecture, engineering and construction

There is a dream that artificial intelligence could be very useful and productive in helping the built environment be updated faster, cheaper and better.

The tools, the people, and the expertise are all available to make this dream happen.

Why isn't it happening?

The reason - as is so frequently the case with technology - the United States of America.

Major CAD vendors are based in America and the biggest CAD market is America.

Whatever works in America is what the vendors build. Whatever can't work in America is what the vendors avoid.

Let's double click into this thought.

The first idea that comes to mind with using AI and building is to use AI to help with designing according to the building codes. If we are talking about United Kingdom or Germany or a normal country. this would be in a eminently doable. But of market size has been too small for the vendors to venture into this field.

In the United States, however, the market has been bin enough but there is no national building code that is actually national. Instead there are tens of thousands local codes - and most of those codes are behind paywalls. it would be a huge process to gather up all those codes and synthesize them into a reasonable AI-based workflow.

A second idea would be to use AI to help with designing certain building types. AI systems could be very helpful in designing better schools. Again the issue is United States. There are 10,000 or school boards and each has its own peculiar megalomania. Beyond that the federal government and the states of government and local governments all have different ideas about supporting private or public schools. And so on.

A third idea would be to drop down to a building products and component level. Heere it kind of gets interesting. the US market is dominated by slab on grade plasterboard on stud construction - with most designs being created by copying and pasting items from catalogs or selecting from spreadsheets. if you want a cheap building you go to America; if you want fine architecture you go to Europe. There may be AI possibilities in the American form of construction but it's hard to guess what that might be. Maybe teams of AI people can figure this out. ;-)

if AI is to be helpful in the built environment

* It is likely to be designed and first implemented outside of United States
* It will be able to access a sufficiently large set of building codes and standards across large numbers of properties in order to generate income for the creators
* The AI must be able to generate outcomes that are faster, cheaper and better then what we have now
