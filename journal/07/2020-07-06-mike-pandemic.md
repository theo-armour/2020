## Mission and Vision


* Help prevent the rate of death from reaching unacceptable levels
* Help prevent the rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic illness form reaching disruptive levels

### Deaths

There is no rate of acceptable deaths in a pandemic. There is no rate of acceptable deaths from cancer, heart disease or car crashes. Pandemics should be treated similarly.

On the other hand, any tome when when there such a number of deaths that the coronary and funeral system is overloaded and ICUs are full then there is a rate of dieing that is unacceptable.

### Illnesses

Much work is done by groups oif people working in teams, squads, shifts, units and the like. With normal attrition rates in an organization losing a few percent of the total workforce is acceptable as long as the absentees are randomly distributed throughout the organization

What may happen in a pandemic is that an entire shift or other grouping may become incapacitated and in turn can disrupt the workflow of the entire organization.

### Mission

_Goals that are difficult are more of a challenge than easy goals. ;-)_

* Help you identify your risks
* Help an organization identify its risks
* Help researchers identify issues and be able to propose solutions 

### Vision

* There is better preparation for the current and future pandemics
* There is greater shared and recorded wisdom regarding what to do and what not to do
* Measurements and evidence that help formulate _ad hoc_ priorities are identified


## Proposed Work Products

### C-19 Checklists, Games or Tracker Apps

* Tracking && precautions
* A possible game, spreadsheet or app
* Versions for laypersons, pro care givers, and planners & researchers
* May or may not be associated with an interactive map
 * "I am an 85 year old Black male. Is there anywhere in Florida where I can go with a reasonable risk?"
 * "I am a high school sophomore living in Montana. What should I be concerned about?"

 
### 3D Maps and other Data Viz

Mission

* To provide fast, easy and free access to large quantities of regional data
* Display data at macro and micro levels
* Link data sets to online, public, authoritative data sources 


Vision

* Obey the clear and scientific responsibility to show factual content in the least obscured way
* People can see nuanced data rather than reductionist data
* Remix demography, economics and epidemiology so as to provide useful results down to census tract level
* People are able to identify individual locales where statewide resources should be supplied by type, quantity and timeline


## Proposed Methodologies

Standards to be obeyed

* Follow [Wikipedia Core Content Policies]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies )
* Follow [Wikipedia Five pillars]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars )
* And: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Principles

Availability
* Everything online
* Available computer, tablet or phone

Document organization

* Organized around Definitions|Glossary and [five Ws]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws ) with FAQ to be added

Sought for Outcomes

* Help identify the probabilities or risk in a variety of situations





##  Definitions | Glossary

* Pod / Cohort
* "Flatten the curve"


## Who: Risk group

The average media story addresses "you" as the average American or the average Armenian or whatever. But you are not the average.

Identifying the risks of you - the person reading this post - is doable

The goal of this section is to provide a number of categories where membership in a category may be established by responding to a small number of queries including:

 * This survey instance: You or for others?
 * Age
 * Number of people in household and their ages
 * Number of people in school or work cohort
 * Race
 * Sex
 
 There should be no limit to the categories or even to the number of questions. But for most people most of the time, a limit of five questions might be a good thing.


## Where: Risk location

 * Pandemic status in state, county, census tract level
 * Establish smallest available location for current subject
 * Track high, medium, low
 * Track actual location: street corner, park, mall
 * Indoors/outdoors
 * Ventilation

## When: Risk duration
 * Days, hours, minutes
 * Every day, once a week etc
 * morning noon or night

## What: Risk purpose

 * See Maslow's hierachy of needs


## How:
 * How many people
 * How many sick or immune
 * How essential

## Why?
