Josh

Below are some glimpses of maps and globes that I design, build and maintain. Please feel at liberty to share this link and any others of interest. And do note that my interest is in inspiring, encouraging and helping people take my efforts and turn into organizational and collaborative efforts. And the call to action is easy peasy: you cannot "unsee" one of my maps. ;-)   

May we all live long and prosper,

Theo

All efforts here are free and open source and available on GitHub.

On any of these projects you can "touch" any of the data points - the sticks that pop out - to get a read out of the data for that region.

One finger to rotate, two to zoom.

All projects are intended to be available on workstation, tablet or phone.


## COVID-19 visualization

The pandemic tracker is a project I was working on March, April and May.

_C19 viz3D_

View and track COVID-19 pandemic data for the entire world sourced from multiple authoritative providers in interactive 3D using JavaScript Three.js WebGL tools.

## The globe as a data table visualizer

The current idea is to take what was learned from the COVID-19 tracker and apply it to other data visualization issues. The following scenarios are a work-in-progress.

Each one of the globes contains an ["Easter egg"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media) ) as an indication of our, heh heh, undying appreciation we must give to health and other service industry personnel who are risking their existences for the people of the world.

And there is a [And one more thing..."]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote#%22One_more_thing...%22 ) - just to "elevate" matters a bit.

Click on any globe to stop its infuriating spinning.

_Globe template_

* A very basic globe written in easy-peasy plain-vanilla JavaScript. 
* Touch any of the data points at the centroid of a country to access a link to its Wikipedia entry and to view its population
* Country and state borders are drawn in blue using [geoJSON]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON ) data from [Natural Earth]( https://www.naturalearthdata.com/ )
* Neat trick: note that the text appears left to right no matter if you are looking at it back-to-front.

_Globe Population Cities_

See also: [Globe Template README ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-covid-19-viz-3d/readme.html#cookbook/globe-population-cities/README.md)

* Same as above with a big difference: The globe loads and display data points for **_15,394_** cities!
* Data courtesy of [Simple Maps]( https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities )
* Touch a data point to see city and country, latitude and longitude, capital and population etc.
* Keep zooming in to see more and more cities

_Globe Pandemic Worldometer_

See also: [Globe Pandemic Worldometer README ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-covid-19-viz-3d/readme.html#cookbook/globe-pandemic-worldometer/README.md)

* Same as above with a big difference: This globe scrapes the latest available pandemic data in real time!
* Data courtesy of [Worldometer]( https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ )
* Numbers are updated each time you load the chart

## Smaller Area Investigations

The problems to be solved include:

* Moving seamlessly between macro and micro levels of detail with 3D mapping
* Remixing pandemics and economics into regional and local visualizations
* Providing attraction to the casual viewer to return frequently by gamifying visualizations
* Providing attraction to researchers by enabling the interplay between many complex variables to be viewed interactively

## Other current projects


### [2020-06-13 Brian]( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/#journal/06/2020-06-13-brian.md)

This journal entry links to some of the other map types I design, build and maintain.


### [Ladybug.Tools / Spider 2020 ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2020/#README.md )

Most of the efforts here revolve around data visualizations of energy analysis for the construction industry.
