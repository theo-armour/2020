Josh

Below are some glimpses of maps and globes that I design, build and maintain. Please feel at liberty to share this link and any others of interest. And do note that my interest is in inspiring, encouraging and helping people take my efforts and turn into organizational and collaborative efforts. And the call to action is easy peasy: you cannot "unsee" one of my maps. ;-)   

May we all live long and prosper,

Theo

All efforts here are free and open source and available on GitHub.

On any of these projects you can "touch" any of the data points - the sticks that pop out - to get a read out of the data for that region.

One finger to rotate, two to zoom.

All projects are intended to be available on workstation, tablet or phone.


## COVID-19 visualization

Here is a project I was working on March, April and May.

### Full screen: [C19 viz3D]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-covid-19-viz-3d/ )

View and track COVID-19 pandemic data for the entire world sourced from multiple authoritative providers in interactive 3D using JavaScript Three.js WebGL tools.

## The globe as a data table visualizer

The current idea is to take what was learned from the COVID-19 tracker and apply it to other data voz issues. The following is a work-in-progress.

## Smaller Area Investigations

The problems to be solved include:

* Moving seamlessly between macro and micro levels of detail with 3D mapping
* Remixing pandemics and economics into regional and local visualizations
* Providing attraction to the casual viewer to return frequently by gamifying visualizations
* Providing attraction to researchers by enabling the interplay between many complex variables to be viewed interactively

## Other current projects

### [2020-06-13 Brian( https://theo-armour.github.io/2020/#journal/06/2020-06-13-brian.md)

This journal entry links to some of the other map types I design, build and maintain.


### [Ladybug.Tools / Spider 2020 ]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2020/#README.md )

Most of the efforts here revolve around data visualizations of energy analysis for the construction industry.
