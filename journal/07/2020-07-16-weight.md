one of my favorite sayings about myself is called an "my ship came in on the sunny side of Easy Street."

this combined 3 standard idioms regarding good luck

* "my ship came in
* "[On the sunny side of]( https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/sunny+side )"
* "Living On the Easy Street"

no I certainly haven't been smarter than others and I haven't been that much luckier than others. 


Two of my other Favorite sayings are

* pulling lemons out of lemonade
* every Silver Lining has a cloud

I tend to use these phrases in describing people that are not as optimistic as I am.

I mention these two phrases because I think I've been pretty darn good at doing precisely the opposite: of wringing something positive out of a tough situation.

Here is the tough situation

I am quite diligent about self quarantining. this means not going to any of the man, many good restaurants in my neighborhood. it means not socializing with my friends. it neat means not taking advantage of the ferry building, Chinatown and North Beach that tell an amazing variety of excellent food products.

On the other hand living in this connected era in a location that is a cornucopia of consumables it could mean ordering in Pizza, caviar, chicken tikka masala, Big Macs, foie gras, Michael Minna's Tuna crudo, cases of ginger beer and Babe Ruth candy bars, ten pound boxes of locally produced vegetables, meats & cheeses and whatever.

on the other hand it also can give opportunity to a third way of thinking. in a life with little change, he's a life that enables don't break the chain

Here is what I decided

I could completely control what I was eating. 
my friend Patrick we buy everything and anything available from my local Safeway supermarket
nothing was spur-of-the-moment in the store
everything was set down on you in an email

if everything you can eat is in the fridge
and everything in the fridge is healthy
guuess what?
you have to eat healthy

and that is with a few exceptions what I have been doing. and what do the results look like?

Here is an exmple

this weight represents the amount of pounds I have lost since February. in other words I have 15 pounds of wight from March to July.

I have turning done this by turning part of a yucky experience into motivator for a positive experience.

But weight, there's more

in 1980 when I was practicing to swim the English Channel I weigh 180 pounds. In 1995 or so - sometime after stopping smoking I weighed as much as 245 pounds. ever since I've been losing a couple of pounds a year. Today I weight a bit oveer 181 pounds,

fingers crossed in a few weeks I will be down to the way I was when I was the fittest in my adult life. coming back down to 180 or just a bit below has been a dream of mine ever since I finished the swim and started putting on weight. so I may be soon about to accomplish a personal goal  that is 40 years old.

and this brings up some fabulously interesting thoughts.

will achieving in this 40 years goal make me happy?

yes of course when I step on the scale and see that magic number 179.99 I will jump for joy.  not easy with my withered legs but I can try.

but the issue is I'm already happy. this little girl will have to fit in with all the other accomplishment sitting in the closet of the things done.

(Did you notice that I am pulling a cloud out of a silver lining here? ;-)

will achieve in this go make me healthier?

being healthy something it's difficult to quantify. what will usually looked at is things that make you unhealthy. so yes going from an obese weight down to a normal weight will make me less unhealthy.

will achieving this goal make anything better?

Well, it is certainly making it easier for me to get up and out of a chair. but, frankly, the effects are not really life-changing.

so did anything good come out of this? Are there any benefits to achieving long-standing goals?

Yes, for sure. But maybe they are a bit weird. The benenists are measurable in time and accomplishement

for a lot of people in the world today their goals are measured in

* can I get through the work day today
* can I get to church on time
* should I do to my laundry today

the duration of each thing is quite short - often measured in hours or a few days
or a few days. the long-term goal maybe what are we doing for Halloween or Valentine's Day.
and once or twice your life is a long-term goal such as graduating from college or planning a wedding

the other aspect is that most of these goals are set by society. you found your mother on her birthday because Society tells you you should do this.
you create a great barbecue event on Memorial Day because Society tells you this will make you haappy.

thank goodness, for the most part most people are like this.

and thank goodness there are a few crazies as well.

Off the top of my head here is a defintion of what that crazineess is

* Sets goals or objectives or establishes a mission or vision that is of long duration
* a set of tasks decided by you that can apply to just you
* an accomplishment that creates a measurable difference, produces new evidence

See SMART goals

So where to go from here?

Interesting question. Most definitely the goal of losing another 60 lb is out of the question. that would make me anorexic.

the goal would be to make the diet healthier, tastier and more fulfilling

another goal might be to take the Lessons Learned here and apply them to other aspects of daily life.

Why?

the challenge is the challenge. because it's there. Because we can.

We exist, of course. but obeying the challenge is seeing if there's more to life than just mere existence.

Aside

I pick up a pebble in a stream. wonder how and why the molecules in this pebble have managed to stay there for millions of years. given entropy, the flow of water, and all the other bits is Pebble could have disappeared long ago. somehow it is here. Why? because it can.

why have I lost 15 lb? because I can. 



and if one day in the near future you happen to hear a tiny voice way, way far away shouting "bingo!", you can guess that 179.999 has been achieved.
