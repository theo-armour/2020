It's good to kick off with the joy of using metal to cut wood - which comes along with the schizophrenia of making hand-made things using factory made things.

A very nice choice to start off with. Perhaps one of the most famous statements in physics is from Archimedes: "Give me a place to stand and with a lever I will move the whole world." The lever is perhaps the most the most powerful tool imaginable. The chisel is wedge is a lever. There has yet to be a chisel big enough to move the Earth but they are nonetheless very powerful tools that can help you create something new with every stroke.

Many more very tiny levers. Another counter play between factory-manufactured incredibly-precise machine-tooled steel and the free-form hand-cutting of wood.

As Peter Drucker said "What gets measured gets improved." or "You can’t manage what you don’t measure."
