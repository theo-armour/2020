Trying to improve a few levels of "doing":

‚è∞ Level 1-Activity-based "doing"

* consuming, learning, participating

::BrainLevel:: 2-Deliberate-based "doing

* practicing, understanding, be curious, ask Qs

::Fireworks:: Level 3, Production

* creating, teaching, be creative


## Examples of Level 1 Activity-based "doing"

* watching a tutorial
* attending a conference
* reading a book
* listening to a podcast
* joining a meetup

## Examples of Level 2 Deliberate-based "doing"

* taking notes from your learning
* asking questions from someone you want to learn from
* make it a habit to train yourself doing "Level 1"
* thinking & cross-pollinating key concepts

## Examples of Level 3 Production-based "doing:

* creating & sharing contents 
* teaching others 
* coding an app
* making & selling a product
* building a business
* marketing your side projects
