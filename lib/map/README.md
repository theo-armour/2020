## Concept


### Problems to be solved

* A better outcome for any construction project must consider access to the site and the terrain of the site
* A better outcome for COVID-19 prevention must consider the ability to view the statistics at all levels of detail raging from global perspective down to the "nitty-gritty" of a neighborhood
* A better outcome for virtual Burning Man events must consider the visualization of temples and other installations at multiple venues around the world - and in your backyard

### Features

* Create a hackable 3D map - easy-peasy code - single dependency: three.js
* Light weight code hosted on static server scraping needed data at run-time
* Any latitude, longitude and zoom level
* Bitmaps from any global bitmap tile server
* Fully asynchronous - let it all happen whenever it wants to happen
* Access to Google Geocoder provides fast and easy access to latitude and longitude
* Any location may be re-accesses by permalinks created on-the-fly



## To Do / Wish List

* Enable selecting from the various sources bitmap tile servers 
* Enable the bitmaps and heigh maps to use different zoom levels - in rder to have te bitmaps represent greater detail and to allow for lower resolution height maps on slower devices
* Enable selecting the number of roes and columns to tiles to display
* Update the height scale in real time with a slider
* Add buildings wherever the data is available
* Add Sun range and analemma diagrams
* Add a Burning Man "street map" to any location and have it "decal" the terrain
* Add interaction, titling, GeoJSON mapping overlays
* And people dancing in the street
