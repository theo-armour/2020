The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector is a notoriously unproductive industry sector. I build tools to help visualize the data in archaic data systems. See the two demos below.


I build viewers that help visualize the data in several archaic AEC-centered formats. Compare and contrast the output of the two of my viewers below with what is happening in this link:

Both AEC and gaming deal with built environments. If we are to provide better living conditions for the multitude of under-served peeps then we need to bring in fresh vision and fresh voices into and industry that is ready for re-imagining - and that vision may well be provided by gamers.
